; Example makefile
; ----------------
; This is an example makefile to introduce new users of drush_make to the
; syntax and options available to drush_make. For a full description of all
; options available, see README.txt.

; This make file is a working makefile - try it! Any line starting with a `;`
; is a comment.

; Core version
; ------------
; Each makefile should begin by declaring the core version of Drupal that all
; projects should be compatible with.

core = 7.x

; API version
; ------------
; Every makefile needs to declare it's Drush Make API version. This version of
; drush make uses API version `2`.

api = 2

; Core project
; ------------
; In order for your makefile to generate a full Drupal site, you must include
; a core project. This is usually Drupal core, but you can also specify
; alternative core projects like Pressflow. Note that makefiles included with
; install profiles *should not* include a core project.

; Use pressflow instead of Drupal core:
; projects[pressflow][type] = "core"
; projects[pressflow][download][type] = "file"
; projects[pressflow][download][url] = "http://launchpad.net/pressflow/6.x/6.15.73/+download/pressflow-6.15.73.tar.gz"

; CVS checkout of Drupal 6.x core:
; projects[drupal][type] = "core"
; projects[drupal][download][type] = "cvs"
; projects[drupal][download][root] = ":pserver:anonymous:anonymous@cvs.drupal.org:/cvs/drupal"
; projects[drupal][download][revision] = "DRUPAL-6"
; projects[drupal][download][module] = "drupal"

; CVS checkout of Drupal 7.x. Requires the `core` property to be set to 7.x.
; projects[drupal][type] = "core"
; projects[drupal][download][type] = "cvs"
; projects[drupal][download][root] = ":pserver:anonymous:anonymous@cvs.drupal.org:/cvs/drupal"
; projects[drupal][download][revision] = "HEAD"
; projects[drupal][download][module] = "drupal"


; Use Pressflow instead of Drupal core:
projects[pressflow][type] = "core"
projects[pressflow][download][type] = "git"
projects[pressflow][download][url] = "git://github.com/pressflow/7.git"
